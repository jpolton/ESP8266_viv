# ESP8266_viv
ESP8266 management and control of vivarium temperature. Inputs: temperature from DHT22 sensor x2. Output: Relay control of heater and fan.
Temperature is read at the top and bottom of the vivarium. The top temperature controls the heater. The lower temperature controls whether a fan should mix the warm air down.

Added new html file from <script src="https://gist.github.com/jpolton/611681f366708f26a97cca3895066dcf.js"></script>. Not sure how I am supposed to grab these files. Anyway the Google chart example supports multiple lines per plot. IT would be good to produce two plots one for temp and one for humidity. Each plot would have two lines for top and bottom sensor values.

_To do:_
* Set up a new data.sparkfun stream with variables: temp_bot, temp_top, hum_top, hum_bot. Note the order of appearance for later. Save the keys to Evernote.
* The .ino file needs keys for sparkfun and example note
* Edit html to plot extra data
* Edit html with new key
